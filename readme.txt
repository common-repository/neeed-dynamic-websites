NEEED helps you to individually communicate with your visitors. Show dynamic content based on the situation, history and behavior of each visitor.



== Description ==

You know, with NEEED, it’s like any good sales pitch. In the beginning it’s all about attention. Because you are not the only provider. Then it is your job to arouse and increase interest. Only then, as soon as your prospective customer signals a willingness to buy, you begin to sell. You deal with objections and come to a conclusion.

**Please note: The current version requires the Divi Builder or the Divi Theme.**

You can show different content depending on the weather, show a special greeting to returning visitors, make sure that your background images change with the time of the day, only show videos to people who like to watch videos and much more.

The current version support the following conditions:

* Hour of the day
* Day of the week
* Month
* Weather (sunny, cloudy or rainy, Pro-Version only)
* Temperature(Pro-Version only)
* History (new or returning visitor)
* Source (Referrer)
* Behavior (Visitor interacted with specific elements, Pro-Version only)
* Perception (Visitor prefers video, image or text content, Pro-Version only)

You can also combine all these conditions to create more complex rules. Have you ever seen a website that gives you an uplifting thought if you visit on a rainy Monday morning? How cool would that be?

This Basic version is and remains free of charge. Additionally, there is a Pro-Version, that is currently in beta testing. You can sign up on [neeed.me](https://neeed.me) to join the beta test. There is no charge for joining the beta test and you will get a special discount if you want to continue using NEEED Pro after the beta test.
